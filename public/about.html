<h1>About Me</h1>
<p>Hi!....I'm Anne-Aileen Oluwadamilola Johnson, a first year student of the Ghana Communication Technology University, taking a degree course in Computer Science.
  I began my coding journey not too long ago and i'm loving the little wins and general progress of it...(Gives me a sense of acheivement)
  I'm halfway through the HTML course with Angela Yu on Udemy and it's been very interesting and involving.

<p>With a degree in Computer Science, i'm looking to land a job as a Fullstack Web Developer, and acquire some softare developing skills along the way.
  I'm pursuing a career in the Tech field not only because of my interest in Technology, but also because as the world progresses, humans are becoming more and more dependent on technology.
